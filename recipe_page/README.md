## Progress Made:
1. HTML Structure: I have created the basic HTML structure for the recipe page template. This includes placeholders for the recipe name, ingredients, and instructions.
2. CSS Styling: I have designed the CSS styling for the template, including font choices, color schemes. The styling is simple and visually appealing, and it complements the content well.
3. Responsive Design: I have implemented responsive design principles to ensure the template looks good on all screen sizes. This involved using CSS media queries to adjust the layout and styling based on the device's screen size.
